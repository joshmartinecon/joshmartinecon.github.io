# Unit 1 Notes | Statistics for Business II | Spring 2026

## Intro to Statistics

- Applied statistics uses data to evaluate **competing claims about reality**
  - Focused on the question of "compared to what?"

## Variable Types & Distributions Review

- **Numerical**: measured or counted
  - **Discrete**: countable (jumps)
  - **Continuous**: measurable

- **Categorical**: labels or groups
  - **Nominal**: no order
  - **Ordinal**: ordered

- **Histogram**: binned counts of a numerical variable
  - **Shape**:
    - Right / left skewed
    - Symmetric (“bell-shaped”)
    - Uniform
  - **Skewness**: direction of the long tail
  - **Mode(s)**: Unimodal, bimodal, multimodal

## Equations Review

- **Mean**: average value  
  - “What is typical?”

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

- **Variance**: spread around the mean  
  - “How far is the data from average?”

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$
- **Standard deviation**: $\sigma$
