## Data

### Finding the data

## Data

### Cleaning the data

- 25m $\times$ 200 data frame

- What level *should* the analysis ideally be preformed at?

- What level *can* the analysis be preformed at?

## Data

### Creating a panel dataset

- Assign a date for everyone

  - Date of discharge
  - Current date
  - Latest date
  - First removed

- Time in foster care = Date – first removed

## Data

### Creating a panel dataset

- I chose to aggregate the data
  1. Computational simplicity
  
  2. Controlling for the population of children in foster care
  
## Data

### Dependent variables

- Data frame creation (County by State by Year)

- Tabulation = number of children interacting with the foster care system per year

  - Total Discharges = Aggregate number of individuals with any “discharge reason”
  - Parental Reunifications
  - Adoptions = living with Other relatives, adoption or guardianship
  - “Bad” Discharges = emancipation, transfer to Another Agency, runaway, or death
  - Still in system = foster care – total discharges
  
## Early Work

### Research is a trial and error process

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}
- I bit off more than I could chew --  simultaneously studing the impact of:
  - Same-sex marriage, Domestic partnership / civil unions, Legislative Bans, Constitutional Bans

- Extrapolated evidence that I did not provide

- I introduced a “novel” new empirical method
  - 25% of the paper was methods

## In-Class Exercise

### Massachusetts & Vermont

- What is the appropriate "time window"

  - All states eventually legalize SSM
  
- Do we need to omit any "treated" states from this time window?

- Create an indicator variable for "treatment" (SSM)

- What dependent variable should we use?

- Do we need any control variables
