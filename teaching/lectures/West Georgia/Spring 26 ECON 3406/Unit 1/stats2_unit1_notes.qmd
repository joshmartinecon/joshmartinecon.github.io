# Unit 1 Notes \| Statistics for Business II \| Spring 2026

## Intro to Statistics

-   Applied statistics uses data to evaluate **competing claims about reality**
    -   Focused on the question of "compared to what?"

## Variable Types & Distributions Review

-   **Numerical**: measured or counted
    -   **Discrete**: countable (jumps)
    -   **Continuous**: measurable
-   **Categorical**: labels or groups
    -   **Nominal**: no order
    -   **Ordinal**: ordered
-   **Histogram**: binned counts of a numerical variable
    -   **Shape**:
        -   Right / left skewed
        -   Symmetric ("bell-shaped")
        -   Uniform
    -   **Skewness**: direction of the long tail
    -   **Mode(s)**: Unimodal, bimodal, multimodal

## Equations Review

-   **Mean**: average value
    -   "What is typical?"

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i
$$

-   **Variance**: spread around the mean
    -   "How far is the data from average?"

$$
\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2
$$ 

- **Standard deviation**: $\sigma$

## Case Study: Stents and Stroke Risk

- Goal: Test whether **stents reduce stroke risk**
  - **Stroke**: Brain cell death caused by reduced blood flow
  - **Stent**: Small mesh tube used to keep arteries open
  
- Study design: **Randomized control trial (RCT)**
  - Random assignment -> comparable groups
  - **Control**: Medical management only
  - **Treatment**: Stents + MM
  - MM = medication + risk factor factor control + lifestyle changes
  
## Case Study: Visalizing the Data

```{r}
#| echo: true

# read in data
df30 <- read.csv("data/stent30.csv")
df365 <- read.csv("data/stent365.csv")

```

## Descriptive Statistics

- **Descriptive statistics** summarize data at a glance
  - In R:
    - Tabulate: 'table()'
    - Summarize: 'summary()'
    - Aggregation: 'aggregate()'

```{r}
#| echo: true

# create summary stats
table(df30)
table(df365)

# merge data frames into one
## notation: 'df[row,column]'
## notation: call data frame 'df$group'

x <- data.frame(
  patient_id = 1:451,
  treated = ifelse(df30$group == "treatment", 1, 0),
  event_30 = ifelse(df30$outcome == "stroke", 1, 0),
  event_365 = ifelse(df365$outcome == "stroke", 1, 0)
)

# summarize data
summary(x)

# mean
sum(x$event_30) / nrow(x)
mean(x$event_30)

# variance
deviation <- x$event_30 - mean(x$event_30)
deviation_sq <- deviation^2
sum_dev_sq <- sum(deviation_sq)
variance <- sum_dev_sq / (nrow(x) - 1)
variance
var(x$event_30)

# std. dev.
std_dev <- sqrt(variance)
std_dev
sd(x$event_30)

# aggregation
y <- aggregate(cbind(event_30, event_365) ~ treated, data = x, mean)
y

# difference between groups (pct. points)
effect_30 <- y$event_30[2] - y$event_30[1]
effect_30
effect_365 <- y$event_365[2] - y$event_365[1]
effect_365

# convert percentage point differences into percent differences
pct_diff_30 <- effect_30 / mean(x$event_30)
pct_diff_365 <- effect_365 / mean(x$event_365)
pct_diff_30
pct_diff_365

# transpose; convert to matrix
m <- t(y[,2:3])
m <- as.matrix(m)
colnames(m) <- y$group
m

# plot bar chart
par(mar = c(2.5, 4.5, 1, 1))
barplot(
  m,
  beside = TRUE,
  ylab = "Hospitalization",
  xlab = "",
  cex.lab = 1.5, cex.axis = 1.25, cex.names = 1.25,
  names.arg = c("0-30 Days", "0-365 Days"),
  col = c("plum", "blue"),
  legend.text = c("Control", "Treatment"),
  args.legend = list(x = "topleft", bty = "n", cex = 1.25)
)

```
  
## Random Chance or Real Effect?

- Observed difference: Rates differ by **9 percentage points** between groups

- Why this likely reflects a real effect:
  - Larger samples reduce random fluctuation
  - Larger differences are less likely due to chance

- Context matters:
  - 9 (7.8) p.p. difference vs. mean of 10.2% (16.2%)
  - ≈ **88% (48%) increase** relative to the mean

## Outliers

- **Standardization (z-scores)**
  - $z_i = \dfrac{x_i - \bar{x}}{sd(x)}$
  - Common cutoff: $|z| \geq 2$
  - Upside: Simple
  - Downside: Sensitive to distribution shape
