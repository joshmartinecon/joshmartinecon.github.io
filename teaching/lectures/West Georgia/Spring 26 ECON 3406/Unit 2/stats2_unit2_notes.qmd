## Intro to Probability

- The **probability** of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.
- Probability is a **long-run proportion**, so it always lies between 0 and 1.

## Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

- Example: rolling a fair die many times.
  - Let $\hat{p}_n$ be the proportion of rolls that equal 1 after $n$ rolls.
  - As $n$ increases, $\hat{p}_n \rightarrow p = \frac{1}{6}$.
  
- The **Law of Large Numbers** states that as the number of observations increases, the sample proportion $\hat{p}_n$ of an outcome converges to the true probability $p$.

- In small samples, the sample proportion may appear to "defy" the Law of Large Numbers.
  - These deviations are normal due to randomness.
  - As the number of observations grows, the deviations become smaller and the proportion stabilizes around $p$.

```{r}
# Draw one value from 1 through 6
# This simulates rolling a fair six-sided die once
# 1:6 → possible outcomes (the faces of the die)
# size = 1 → number of rolls
# replace = TRUE → allows the same number to appear again in future rolls

sample(1:6, size = 1, replace = TRUE)

```
